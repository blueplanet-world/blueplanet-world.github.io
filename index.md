# Welcome to the Blue Planet Wiki
On this site you can find the worldbuilding happening right now. 

## About the project
The story follows Rostafr Nibelund, an officer from the Magic Safety Commission, on his way to retrieve all the lost magical artifacts of Isfiro. Very inspired by the adventures of Corto Maltese and the story-telling style of Witch Hat Atelier. This is all to satisfy my inner worldbuilder freak, no crazy plot planned. To keep the story exciting, I won't post about the characters here.
