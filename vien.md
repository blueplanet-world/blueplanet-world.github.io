## Society and culture
### Minorities
Apart from native Viennese, Viên has been home to Qiaao and Arvatakën minorities for a few centuries. These minorities integrate very well and still maintain their original cultures. Native Viennese generally accept them as their fellow Viennese and on the surface there's no discrimination. However, there has been debates on Vien's actual inclusivity towards these communities. 
Vien is also home to many international merchants who don't speak their language. Therefore, the average Viennese knows at least 2 languages and are somewhat used to foreigners. The merchants who open shops around the harbor area are called "boaties", locals love going here to get exports for a cheap price.
### Architecture
Viennese architecture is built for resilience, as they have floods annually. Over the years, they have learnt to live with water with a lot of flood infrastructure and a substantial amount of elemental magician citizens. Aesthetic wise, they're a mix of Hội An, Venice, Phoenix Old Town.
### Art & Craft
1. **Water puppet:** an important aspect of the Viennese community.
2. **Ceramics:** Viennese ceramics usually come in blue and white.
3. **Metalurgy:** metal artifacts welded by Viennese blacksmiths are famous for their low magic resistance. Being the trading hubs for so many countries, Vien easily negates their lack of natural resources. Metal used for welding in Viên could come from anywhere.
### Calendar
Vien follows the standard calendar. A few holidays in Viên you might be interested:

### Social Customs
- **In general, Viennese people are extroverted and like to chat.** They're essentially collectivists and can get very protective if an outsider is acting strange towards their people. They're also very quick to spot who isn't following their norms, and could be a bit standoff-ish to these people.
- **Viennese people take great pride in their house.** They spend a lot of time around the house and love it when guests stay at their house so they could show off how well they have taken care of their home.
