# The Magic System
## Origin
Magic is an inseperatible part of the world, just like physics laws (instead of using sciences people just explain everything with magic in this world, gravity is Earth's magic). Everyone just accepts it as it is, no one ever thinks that it's unrealistic. Some religions believe that a deity of their own granted magic to the world.

## Who gets the magic
As a natural force, magic can be used at first by a a limited number of magicians and then later widely popularized as magical artifacts. Some countries allow all of its citizens to use magic, while some limit magic to a certain group of people. The debate for this is complicated, and the power to control magic further contributes to inequalities in some countries.

Born magic doesn't exist in this world, it all boils down to who learns to use magic well and who doesn't. People often need to go to magic schools to get license for using magic. Outlawed use of magic might get them jailed.

While each country often have magic regulation laws of their own, international magic use is regulated by the [Aperium](aperium.md). These are anointed knights (often called *beekeepers*) that go around to stop governments and international criminals from misusing magic. 
Fundamentally, magic is finding the form for your intention. From this one law, magic has developed into many things within the past few centuries. Currently, there are a few major schools of magic:
- **Elemental:** magic that shifts natural elements such as water, fire, soil,... Elemental magic is considered the oldest form of magic.
	- The practice of using Elemental magic on a human body is heavily regulated. For example, only magicians with a healing license can cast certain elemental spells on their patients.
- **Script:** also called curse, magic that uses words (whether written or verbally) to deliver intents. By far the most popular form of magic for its application in manufacturing.
	- Scripts can also be used to enhance or curse an existing object. The power of script is limited by the object's magic resistance. The higher this property, the less effect magic has on it. An ideal object needs to have as low resistance as possible.
	- The use of scripts on human body is banned by the Aperium.
- **Formation:** considered an advanced form of Elemental where the user could extract elements from an object and use these element to form something else. So far, not many people know about this practice. The most prominent user of Formation is Rostafr Nibelund.
	- **Alchemy** is believed to be the early form of Formation. Alchemy was greatly disregarded as a real magic practice as its outcomes were inferior to other forms of magic.
 - **Artifacts:** a more common and less official use of magic, as commonfolks are able to access artifacts easily. Artifacts are used in everyday life, they're sold everywhere. Artifacts often have to go through a very strict registeration procedure before they're allowed to be on the market.

## Magic education
Generally, magic education is offered in limit in most countries. While most magic education institutions are considered higher education, some middle schools or high schools offer magic education to their best students. Families with magic traditions tend to teach their children magic from a young age, but this kind of education is unattainable to most families outside of the magic world.

Magic education is divided into two streams:
- **Academic magic**: students from this stream usually work in institutions to research new ways of applying magic. They sometimes get made fun of for being impractical and useless in urgent matters.
- **Applied magic**: the more common stream, as students from this stream have a more diverse range of employment. They however don't have magic theory foundation as strong.

It has been a trend for nations to invest in magic education, however, this has also been heavily regulated by the Commission as they demand countries to limit the annual magic graduates to ensure all safety measures are followed properly.
